My teaching philosophy has been deeply shaped by Dr. Dawn Laux who I learned the importance of positive reinforcement in education. Inspired by this approach, I view teaching not mearly as the delivery of knowledge, but as a responsibility to foster curiosity, critical thinking, and independent learning.
