I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University, working with members in Human-AI Interaction (HAI) lab. 

My work spans Human-Robot Interation (HRI), social psychology-inspired AI, and socially-aligned robot behaviors. I'm interested in bringing robots closer to people in meaningful and intuitive ways. 

While some may see my goals as overly ambitious, I am someone who pursues what I truly believe in with persistence and sincerity. 

You can find my publications, ongoing projects, and contact information through this website.
