My passion for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) began during a student exchange program at Purdue University, where I first encountered the DARwIn-OP robot. Captivated by its expressiveness and charm, I found myself instinctively embracing the robot, feelign an immediate and profound connection to the idea of social robotics. 

After returning, I took a Human-Computer Interaction course of Dr. Kang-Hee Lee, where we studied Dr. Cynthia Breazel's *Designing Sociable Robots* and worked with a simulated version of the Jibo robot. This experience profoundly changed the course of my life, shaping my aspiration to pursue research in social robots, and the book remains a constant source of inspiration. I always keep it within reach where I can see it every day. 

Motivated by this vision, I decided to continue my academic journey into graduate study, focusing on socially adaptive robotic systems. Nearly every step of my academic and professional path, through two multi-robot laboratories, has been directed toward enabling meaningful interactions between humans and robots. 

My multidisciplinary experiences, including work with sensors, mobile platforms, computer vision and languages, psychological frameworks, and statistical validation, have all contributed to advancing this vision.  

While some may see my goals as overly ambitious, I am someone who pursues what I truly believe in with persistence and sincerity.
