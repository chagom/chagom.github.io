## Research Interests
- Human-Robot Interaction (HRI); Physical Robot Interaction
- Socially-aware AI systems; Vision-Language Models
- Group Dynamics

I'm sometimes getting emails about why I chose to focus on social robots instead of pursuing purely robotics and computer vision. My graduate studies have always been directed, since 2016, toward social robotics. The path was not always direct, but the choices I made have shaped the way how I approach this field. Not every turn was entirely mine to choose, and arriving at the field I wanted to be in took many years, shaped in part by circumstances far outside what most people ever face. I now believe I am in the right place to keep building my world.  

If you are curious about the motivation behind my journey: [here](/research_root/).
