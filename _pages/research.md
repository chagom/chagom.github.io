## Research Interests
- Human-Robot Interaction (HRI); Physical Robot Interaction
- Socially-aware AI systems; Vision-Language Models
- Group Dynamics

I'm sometimes getting emails about why I chose to focus on social robots instead pursuing towards purely robotics and computer vision. My graduate studies have always been directed, from 2016, toward social robotics. Although the route has not always been direct, the choices I made have contributed meaningfully to how I approach this field. The work presented here is shaped by those experiences.
